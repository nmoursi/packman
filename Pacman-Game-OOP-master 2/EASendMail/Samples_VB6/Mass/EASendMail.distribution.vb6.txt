Manifest file:
    - Describes the names and versions of shared side-by-side assemblies that the application should 
      bind to at run time and may also contain metadata for private side-by-side assemblies used by the application.
      It helps to distribute EASendMail ActiveX/COM object without regsvr32.exe.
